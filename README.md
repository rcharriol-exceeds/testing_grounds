# testing_grounds

**Where stuff gets tested. Sometimes it breaks. Often on purpose.**

## What is this?

A place where code goes to either become something cool or to be deleted at 3 AM. No guarantees.

## What we test here

- Ideas that sounded good in the shower  
- Code that "should work"  
- Dependencies we'll forget about in a week  
- Our patience  

## Contributing

2. Break something  
3. Fix it (optional)  
4. Repeat  

## License

Use at your own risk. We're not liable for any existential crises caused by `undefined is not a function`.
